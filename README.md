## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The coolest learning feature is based below for MOBILE FRIENDLY.

When doing a @Media screen for mobiles, by including the below CSS ensures the content is rendered nicely in 1 column.

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    grid-template-columns: auto;
    padding-left: 0;
    padding-right: 0;
}
```
